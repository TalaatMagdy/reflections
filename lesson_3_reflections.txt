When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When collaborating with other users it's easier to share updates by using a remote repository. This way others can contribute, and get changes too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Changes can cause conflicts. If you are in the process of creating a new feature, you don't want to solve those conflicts but finish your feature first.
 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub.make changes to a repository when you don't have access to the original repository.
A clone is copy of a repository. This can be on the same machine, also be a clone from a GitHub repository to your device. 
Branches are leafs on the master branch . Use this for creating new features/bug fixes.
